### Object-Oriented
- Robustness of Code
	- Stuffs might change the behaviours when scale up and run for long time
	- Exception and Assertion
### Exception
- Exception is thrown when the error pass through the stack
- try and catch block is to deal with the error
- Exception has class hierachy too, make use of this
