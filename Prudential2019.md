# Overview
- To provide a action plan for the following year

## Goal
- Be a successful financial planner

## Challenge
- Tough competition within industry, both mainland and local market.
- AI enable client servicing less reliant on agent itself, which weaken the role of agents, therefore jeopardizing livelihood of some agents.
- "Big-data" enable insurance company making surgical direct sales call to prospective clients.
- Products cycle are getting shortter and might not match with sales activities, making some of the competing products seem more desirable.

## Possible Solution
### Tough competition
- Competition has always been the same for local market, clients expect top-notch service and advice from planner.
- Competition for mainland will be different later, since mainland clients are becoming more mature and China is going to open market for foreign FI. Advantage of Hong Kong agent is quality financial planning advice

### AI
- Should not make mistakes regarding servicing and cannot solely reply on servicing to maintain relationship with client.
- Instead, should not make any mistakes regarding low-level servicing, and make use of company new tech resources to save mental energy for providing client with real value-add services (more on this later)
- Maybe encourage clients make use of the tools company provided (like myPrudential ... etc) to save agent's attention, and change the perspective of myPrudential vesus agent to myPrudential is a tool for both client/agent.

### "Big-data" direct sales
- Doesnt concern this year at all, but should agent should refrain from "product selling", since the inefficiency of information would be eliminated by "Big-data". Agent should focus on providing hollistic financial planning solution to client, instead of comparing products and this could also avoid comparison, addressing the product cycle challenge as well.
- Ideal picture: Clients can clear express what can the insurance arrangment does, but not what did they buy.

### Direction for concrete action plan
- Provide hollistic financial planning advice
	- Appointment conversation should try to include/limit to the following:
		- Personal Goals
			- To identify personal financial needs
			- Personal goals are often not as easy to discuss, although it's super important, we put it at the top, this is what separate us from Chatbot
			- Also helps "personal touch"
		- Family status
			- To identify possible insurance needs
		- Economic News
			- Real estates, Stock market ... etc
			- become the go-to guy for finance matter, (also easier to refer)
		- Insurance arrangement
			- Present a solution, rather than new product, to clients existing insurance arrangment.
- 

- Recruitment
	- The target audience for prospective recruitment:
		- warm market
		- warm market referral
		- campus recruitment
