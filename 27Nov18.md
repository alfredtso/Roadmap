### Calendar
- Abstract class vs Interface
- Interface only method signatures, Abstract class has implementation
	- Abstract class implement interface, no need to do all method
	- But subclass needs to implement all i.e the remaining method in interface

#### Paradigm
- Data Abstraction is the main organizing principle for building software
	- Explicit state allows to model change
		- Supports data abstraction too
- Concurrency is a property of systems that are made of activities that progess independently
	- **Deterministic dataflow** is a form of concurrency that always give s same outputs given same inputs

### State
- In FP, there is no notion of time
- Sometimes we will need the concept of time to model change in real 
- We need an abstract concept of time: change
	- e.g a state: a seq of values calculate progressively
- FP can observe implicit state too, but we need explicit ones
	- We will extend the language to enable that
	- **Cell** is a box with a content, box remain the same, content can change
		- a cell is a box with an identity and a content
			- the identity is a constant
			- the content is a variable
