# Lambda Calculus
- Alpha Equivalence
- Beta Reduction
    - apply lambda to args
- Beta normal form
    - cannot be reduced further 
- Combinator
    - a lambda term without free variabales (every in the body occurs in head)
    - serve only be combine args given
- Divergence
    - Not becuase already fully reduced, but rather they diverge
- Redexes
    - Reducible expressions
- Infix style
    -  we can use infix operators in prefix fashion wrapping in paren

# Debugging
- Assertion is good
- Avoid using print statement
- idnetity and break the cause-effect chain
- Scientific
    - Initial Observation
    - Hypothesis
    - Prediction
    - Experiment
    - Observation
