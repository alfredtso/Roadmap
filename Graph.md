# Graph
## Glossary
### Undirected Graph
- Self-loop is an edge connects a vertex itself
- Two edges are parallel if connect same pair of vertices
- An edge connects two vertices, we say vertices are adjacent to one another and the edge is incident on both vertices.
- Degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident in it
- Path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by graph
- A cycle is a path (with at least one edge) whose first and last vertices are the same
- A connected graph if there's a path from every vertex to every other vertex
- Acyclic is a graph with no cycles
- A tree is an cyclic connected graph
- A forest is a disjoint set of trees
